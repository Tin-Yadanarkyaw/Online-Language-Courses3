        <h1 class="page_header_title">Spanish levels</h1>
        <p>
            There are six levels: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2;
             A1 being a total beginner and C2 a proficient user who can speak the language almost at a 
             native level.</p>
             <p><b>A1</b>After you finish an A1 level you will be able to find your way around a city in a 
                Spanish speaking country, to understand touristic or leisure information, to gather
                 your daily/weekly food and beverages supply or to go shopping, or to order in a restaurant.
                  </p>

    <p><b>A2</b>A2 is the level where you start learning about different past tenses in Spanish.
         Thus, you an speak about your past experiences, what you have done in your life and how your 
         life used to be in different stages. </p>    
        
        <p><b>B1</b>In B1 you consolidate your knowledge about the different past tenses and learn about
             a new and complex grammar topic: el subjuntivo. Your richer vocabulary and your ability with
              grammar help you start producing simple connected texts on topics that are familiar or of 
              personal interest. You can also describe experiences and events, dreams, hopes and ambitions and
               briefly give reasons and explanations for opinions and plans. 
            </p>

     <p><b>B2</b>After a B2 level you master the last grammar contents and enrich extremely your vocabulary.
         You also start understanding figurative speech and learn many Spanish expressions. . You can produce clear, detailed text on a wide range of subjects and
         explain a viewpoint on a topical issue giving the advantages and disadvantages of various options</p>
         
         <p><b>C1</b>Learning a C1 level is about reaching the highest level a non-native speaker can achieve.
             You can understand a wide range of demanding, longer clauses, and recognize implicit meaning; 
             express ideas fluently and spontaneously without much obvious searching for expressions; use
              language flexibly and effectively for social, academic and professional purposes. </p>
  
            <p><b>C2</b>At C2 level you can use the language almost as a native speaker. You can express yourself 
                spontaneously, very fluently and precisely, 
                differentiating finer shades of meaning even in the most complex situations.</p>
