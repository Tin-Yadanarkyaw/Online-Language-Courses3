            <p>What Are the Six HSK Levels?</p>
            <p>The six levels within HSK are HSK1, HSK2, HSK3, HSK4, HSK5,
                 and HSK6. HSK1 is the lowest level in terms of ability and HSK6 is the highest.</p>

                 <p>According to Hanban, the HSK organizer, in this system, HSK1 and HSK2 correspond 
                     to very basic Chinese skills. Then, HSK3 and HSK4 introduce more sophisticated knowledge of Chinese.
                      Finally, HSK5 and HSK6 serve as indicators of high proficiency and fluency in Chinese.</p>

                      <p>Since language proficiency is something highly subjective,
                           Hanban offers short descriptors for the six HSK levels and explains what you can do at each level.</p>
      <p><b>HSK1</b></p>
        <p>
            You can understand and use simple words and phrases.
            
        </p> 

        <p><b>HSK2</b></p>
        <p>
            You can communicate simply and directly on daily topics you are familiar with.</p>  
            
            <p><b>HSK3</b></p>
            <p>
                
You can conduct basic 
communication in daily life, study and work. You can manage most communication when traveling in China.
            </p>

            <p><b>HSK4</b></p>
            <p>
You can discuss a relatively wide range of topics in Chinese
 and can communicate with native Chinese speakers fluently in common situations.</p>

 <p><b>HSK5</b></p>
 <p>
    You can read Chinese newspapers and magazines, watch Chinese films and TVs, and 
    can write and deliver a full speech.
    </p>

    <p><b>HSK6</b></p>
    <p>
        You can easily understand what you read and hear, and express yourself
         smoothly in written and oral Chinese.</p>
